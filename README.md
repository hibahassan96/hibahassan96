# Data Science Projects Portfolio
1. [Health Metrics Impact: A Data Visualization Approach [Python:Matplotlib,Seaborn]](https://github.com/hibahassan96/Health-Metrics-Impact-A-Data-Visualization-Approach) - Utilizing the CDC‚Äôs Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) dataset, this project employed advanced data cleaning, normalization, and aggregation techniques to develop a comprehensive Health Index. Through Seaborn and Matplotlib visualizations, we identified a 58% decline in average student health and analyzed the correlation between health metrics and socio-economic outcomes. The findings support policy recommendations including restricting vapor product sales to minors, enhancing nutritional support in schools, and increasing sports participation to address identified health disparities.

2. [The Future of Work: A data-driven approach to understanding the job market [Python:Seaborn,Altair]](https://github.com/hibahassan96/The-Future-of-Work-A-data-driven-approach-to-understanding-the-job-market) - Leveraged Python‚Äôs Pandas and Altair to design a comprehensive analysis of AI‚Äôs impact on job markets and startup ecosystems. We employed advanced data visualization and statistical techniques to investigate AI job postings, regional growth patterns, and startup valuations. Our findings reveal key trends in tech job distribution, regional AI opportunities, and the effects of funding and accelerators on startup success.

3. [Optimization of Food Accessibility [Python | ArcGIS]](https://github.com/hibahassan96/Optimization-of-Food-Accessibility-in-Alleghany-County) - Conducted a comprehensive analysis using GIS and advanced data analytics techniques to address food insecurity in Allegheny County. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and network analysis, identified key census tracts with high SNAP eligibility and significant barriers to accessing EBT-accepting stores, particularly in terms of walk times. These insights were used to prioritize and recommend strategic interventions for the SNAP Policy Division within the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, aimed at enhancing food accessibility and reducing socio-economic disparities in the region.

4. [Geospatial analytics to understand Social Determinants of Health [ArcGIS]](https://github.com/hibahassan96/Geospatial-Analytics-to-understand-Social-Determinants-of-Health) - Leveraged advanced geospatial analytics in ArcGIS Pro to model and visualize social determinants of health (SDOH) among children in Allegheny County. Integrated and spatially joined heterogeneous datasets, including PM2.5 concentrations, obesity prevalence, and housing stability metrics, to construct a multi-layered health risk index. Applied spatial interpolation techniques and conducted hotspot analysis to identify high-risk clusters, informing data-driven recommendations for precision-targeted community interventions.
   
6. [Digital Transformation: A data story [Tableau | Shorthand | Figma]](https://preview.shorthand.com/f0VL0RSaMQNXBT8p#section-Introduction-ZVmJW1jjkR) - Crafted a data-driven narrative on Pakistan's digital transformation using Python for in-depth analysis, Shorthand, Flourish and Infogram for compelling visualizations. Analyzed trends in connectivity and skill development, incorporating user feedback to refine the storyline. Created interactive charts and actionable insights to showcase the transformative impact of mobile connectivity and drive policy advancements.

7. [Financial Inclusion Analytics with R [R]](https://github.com/hibahassan96/Global-Financial-Inclusion-Analytics) - This project utilized the World Bank's Global Findex Database 2021 to analyze global financial service adoption and resistance. Through data cleaning, importation into R, and detailed analysis‚Äîincluding the use of the `likert` package for visualizations‚ÄîI identified demographic and regional disparities in financial service usage. Key findings highlighted younger adults as primary users, significant regional access variations, and barriers such as documentation issues and distrust. Recommendations focus on enhancing digital access and simplifying financial service adoption.
