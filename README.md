# Data Science Projects Portfolio
1. [Health Metrics Impact: A Data Visualization Approach [Python:Matplotlib, Seaborn]](https://github.com/hibahassan96/Health-Metrics-Impact-A-Data-Visualization-Approach) - Utilizing the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) dataset, this project employed advanced data cleaning, normalization, and aggregation techniques to develop a comprehensive Health Index. Through Seaborn and Matplotlib visualizations, we identified a 58% decline in average student health and analyzed the correlation between health metrics and socio-economic outcomes. The findings support policy recommendations including restricting vapor product sales to minors, enhancing nutritional support in schools, and increasing sports participation to address identified health disparities.

2. [The Future of Work: A data-driven approach to understanding the job market [Python:Seaborn, Altair]](https://github.com/hibahassan96/The-Future-of-Work-A-data-driven-approach-to-understanding-the-job-market) - Leveraged Python’s Pandas and Altair to design a comprehensive analysis of AI’s impact on job markets and startup ecosystems. We employed advanced data visualization and statistical techniques to investigate AI job postings, regional growth patterns, and startup valuations. Our findings reveal key trends in tech job distribution, regional AI opportunities, and the effects of funding and accelerators on startup success.

4. Financial Inclusion Analytics with R [R]

5. [Optimization of Food Accessibility [Python][ArcGIS]](https://github.com/hibahassan96/Optimization-of-Food-Accessibility-in-Alleghany-County) - Conducted a comprehensive analysis using GIS and advanced data analytics techniques to address food insecurity in Allegheny County. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and network analysis, identified key census tracts with high SNAP eligibility and significant barriers to accessing EBT-accepting stores, particularly in terms of walk times. These insights were used to prioritize and recommend strategic interventions for the SNAP Policy Division within the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, aimed at enhancing food accessibility and reducing socio-economic disparities in the region.

6. Geospatial analytics to drive Social Determinants of Health [ArcGIS]

7. Empowering Sustainability through Predictive Analytics [Python]
